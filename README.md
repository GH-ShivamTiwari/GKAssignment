## API Documentation

In addition to the Postman collection, we have provided a detailed [Task_Manager_API_Documentation.docx](https://github.com/GH-ShivamTiwari/GKAssignment/blob/main/Task_Manager_API_Documentation.docx) in the repository. This document contains comprehensive instructions on how to set up, run, and test the application, along with prerequisites and configurations. Please visit the `Task_Manager_API_Documentation.docx` file in the repo for further information.
